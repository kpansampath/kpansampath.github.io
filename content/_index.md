Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a visiting scientist at Indian Statistical Institute, Bengaluru.

I received my PhD from the University of Michigan writing a thesis under the supervision of Prof. Kartik Prasanna. Before that, I studied analytic number theory with Prof. Ram Murty at Queen's University. I enjoyed my undergraduate days at Indian Statistical Institute, Bengaluru.

My (current) research interests are

- mod \(p\) and $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence
- \(p\)-adic automorphic forms
- (\(p\)-adic) Galois representations
- Geometry in and near characteristic \(p\)
