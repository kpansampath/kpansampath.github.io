Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a visiting scientist at [Indian Statistical Institute, Bengaluru](https://www.isibang.ac.in/~statmath/). I can be reached at [knsam@umich.edu](mailto:knsam@umich.edu).

I wrote my PhD thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Kartik Prasanna](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~kartikp/) at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math). Before that, I studied analytic number theory with [Prof. Ram Murty](https://mast.queensu.ca/~murty/) at [Queen's University, Kingston](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/). I enjoyed my undergraduate days at the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore{{%sn%}}The city officially became Bengaluru a few months after my graduation{{%/sn%}}.

My (current) research interests are
- mod \(p\) and \(p\)-adic local Langlands correspondence
- \(p\)-adic automorphic forms
- (\(p\)-adic) Galois representations
- Geometry in and near characteristic \(p\)
